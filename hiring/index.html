        <h2>An Uncompromised Vision For Tomorrow</h2>

                <img src="{% asset_path images/products/logo-textsecure-large.png %}" style="float:left;">
<p>Open Whisper Systems makes private communication simple. And we've had some success. Between iOS, Android, WhatsApp, and CyanogenMod, we protect $N million users worldwide, providing security the NSA calls “catastrophically” effective.</p>

<p>Providing these first class tools is our sole mission. We have no monetization schemes, no VC obligations, and no upper management to appease.</p>

        <p>Whisper Systems builds free, open-source software. Every line of code or pixel adjustment is reviewed by a community of thousands. The bar is set high, and our development focuses on quality and correctness. We do not rush features for hard-deadlines, nor hack in fixes without systematic review. Excellence in our work is not just important, its necessary.</p>
