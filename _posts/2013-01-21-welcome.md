Whisper Systems was a company focused on the development of mobile security software, which was acquired by 
Twitter in late 2011.  Twitter very generously made some of the Whisper Systems software available under an 
Open Source license (GPLv3), which has since been under open development by the community.  The software has 
seen a number of new releases based on that open development, and we've been calling the project for this 
continued work "Open Whisper Systems."  Welcome to the project's new home.

This is where we will be promoting, distributing, and coordinating the continued development of mobile security
and privacy software.  In an environment of increasingly pervasive surveillance, we want to make it as easy as
possible for anyone to be able to organize and communicate securely. We hope you'll join us.

Easy ways to get involved are [filing bugs](https://github.com/whispersystems/) (or fixing them!), contributing to
language translations ([here](https://www.transifex.com/projects/p/redphone/) and 
[here](https://www.transifex.com/projects/p/textsecure-official)), creating 
user [documentation](https://github.com/WhisperSystems/RedPhone/wiki), or 
[joining the mailing list](https://lists.riseup.net/www/info/whispersystems).  We appreciate all the help we've gotten
thus far, and hope the momentum continues.
