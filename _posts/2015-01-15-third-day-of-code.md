*A guest post from [BlueMatt](https://twitter.com/thebluematt), Winter Break Of Code Day 3*

As it does every morning, the day started with moxie singing the standup song, reminding us all
(and waking up the slackers) that at 9am sharp we all get in a circle to discuss what we
accomplished the day before and what our priorities are for the coming day.

XXXXX

Wednesday morning's standup also included a decision to take a late-afternoon drive up the coast for
a sunset picnic.  Most of the day was spent working, but that didn't stop random activities from
breaking out, like the push-up contest Christine organized -- in which many of the Winter Break of Code
attendees found themselves fighting to keep pace, get their push-up count up into the thirties, and
avoid Jake sprawling out on the floor.

In the late afternoon, after placing the largest sushi order a local sushi restaurant
had ever filled, we all piled into our two cars and drove up the coast to Haena State Park.
There we alternated between staring out into the Pacific, climbing the roots(!) of a giant
tree, and watching waves crash into the setting sun.

By the time the twilight faded, we had finished comparing the effect of the modern definition
of self with the historical result of religion on society, and headed home to spend the rest of the
evening designing UX, building GUIs, and refactoring code towards more great Open Whisper Systems
apps.
